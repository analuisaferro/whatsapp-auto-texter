# whatsapp-auto-texter 

A little Selenium script that automates sending messages to WhatsApp phone numbers obtained from a CSV file. The script reads the numbers from the CSV, composes a predefined (or not) message, and utilizes Selenium to interact with the WhatsApp web interface to send the messages automatically.
